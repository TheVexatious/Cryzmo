# Cryzmo
A simple cryptographic tool to encrypt your files

this is currently only meant for windows so don't bug me about anything this is tested on other than windows. i might try and release other versions when i'm not lazy. :eyes:

and i guess, look through the releases and try it yourself.

### todo:
* write the readme.
